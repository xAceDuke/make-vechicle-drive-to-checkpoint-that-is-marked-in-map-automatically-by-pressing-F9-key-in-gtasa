# A Cleo script that will make a vehicle drive to a checkpoint that is marked on the map automatically when you press the F9 key:

In this script, when you press the F9 key, it will get the handle of the vehicle the player is in and the position of the waypoint marker on the map. It will then drive the vehicle to the waypoint and stop the vehicle when it reaches the checkpoint.

To use this script, you would need to save it as a .cs file and place it in your Cleo folder in the San Andreas directory. You can then run the game, mark a checkpoint on the map, and press the F9 key to make the vehicle drive to the checkpoint automatically.

# This script allows the player to drive their vehicle to a waypoint marker on the map when they press the F9 key. Here's how it works:

The script defines a constant for the F9 key and a variable for the minimum distance from the waypoint to stop the vehicle.
The script starts an infinite loop that checks if the F9 key is pressed and if the player is currently playing.
If the F9 key is pressed and the player is playing, the script gets the handle of the player's vehicle and the position of the waypoint marker.
If a waypoint marker exists on the map, the script drives the vehicle towards the waypoint using the DriveTo method, which sets the vehicle's speed, turns it towards the waypoint, and drives it forward until it reaches the waypoint.
While the vehicle is driving towards the waypoint, the script checks if the distance between the vehicle and the waypoint is less than the minimum distance threshold.
If the distance is less than the threshold, the script stops the vehicle and breaks out of the loop.
Note: This script is written in CLEO, a custom scripting language for the PC version of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.
