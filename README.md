#A Cleo script that will make a vehicle drive to a checkpoint that is marked on the map automatically when you press the F9 key:

In this script, when you press the F9 key, it will get the handle of the vehicle the player is in and the position of the waypoint marker on the map. It will then drive the vehicle to the waypoint and stop the vehicle when it reaches the checkpoint.

To use this script, you would need to save it as a .cs file and place it in your Cleo folder in the San Andreas directory. You can then run the game, mark a checkpoint on the map, and press the F9 key to make the vehicle drive to the checkpoint automatically.
